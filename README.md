Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

Simple flask app that plays Tic Tac Toe with you. Try to beat it! :)

## Getting Started
First install Flask on your computer
```
pip install Flask
```

Once Flask has been successfully installed clone the respository onto your local machine. Enter into project directory and run the main.py file with command:
```
FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
```
The application will begin running on your localhost and you should be met with a menu to select color(Red, Blue) and whether you want to move first or second. After that, you will be met with an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe computer!
